# Assembly Name Sorting Program 🖥️

<p>This project is a straightforward assembly language program built using emu8086. It enables users to input names, select a sorting method (ascending ⬆️ or descending ⬇️), and display the sorted results. The program is designed to demonstrate the low-level implementation of sorting algorithms while reinforcing key computer architecture concepts 🧑‍💻.</p>

## Features:
<p>📝 Input a specified number of names and their lengths.</p>
<p>🔄 Perform ascending or descending sorting using an efficient algorithm.</p>
<p>📋 Display the sorted names on-screen.</p>
<p>✅ Includes validation for user input and error handling.</p>

## Technology:
<p>Developed with emu8086, simulating the 8086 microprocessor 🛠️.</p>

## Project Objective:
<p>The main goal of this project is to enhance students' understanding of assembly language programming and sorting algorithms 📚. By working on this program, students will explore low-level programming concepts and gain practical experience with computer architecture 💡.</p>
