# Assembly-Name-Sorter
This project is a straightforward assembly language program built using emu8086. It enables users to input names, select a sorting method (ascending or descending), and display the sorted results. The program is designed to demonstrate the low-level implementation of sorting algorithms while reinforcing key computer architecture concepts.

Features:
Input a specified number of names and their lengths.
Perform ascending or descending sorting using an efficient algorithm.
Display the sorted names on-screen.
Includes validation for user input and error handling.
Technology:
Developed with emu8086, simulating the 8086 microprocessor.
Project Objective:
The main goal of this project is to enhance students' understanding of assembly language programming and sorting algorithms. By working on this program, students will explore low-level programming concepts and gain practical experience with computer architecture.
